# hello-world
Initial setup project.
Completing my AAS in CIS with a focus on the C# and OOP certifications. I intend to graduate with a 3.9+ GPA and am in the process of attempting to transition to the software
development and engineering field. I'm told this is a tough industry to merge into, and I say: Good. I love a challenge!

To further educate and challenge myself I have enrolled into Coding Dojo and will be doing an online, part-time bootcamp with the intention of learning the MERN stack. I feel like this will be super fun but also will round out my data structure and basic coding knowledge with some actual hands-on stack technology used in the workforce.
