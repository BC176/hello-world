# hello-world
Initial setup project.
Completing my AAS in CIS with a focus on the C# and OOP certifications. I intend to graduate with a 3.9+ GPA and am in the process of attempting to transition to the software
development and engineering field. I'm told this is a tough industry to merge into, and I say: Good. I love a challenge!
